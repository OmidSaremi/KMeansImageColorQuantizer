KMeansImageColorQuantizer
=========================

This Java application "Image color quantizer" employs K-means unsupervised learning algorithm to reduce the 
number of colors in an image, based on a compression level selected by user. It comes with a simple Java Swing GUI. The Java linear algebra library <a href="https://code.google.com/p/efficient-java-matrix-library/">EJML</a> (Efficient Java Matrix Library) was used. This project does not employ any of the pre-existing Machine Learning libraries such as <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"> scikit-learn.</a> A Mac native app version, created using appbundler, can also be found here.
